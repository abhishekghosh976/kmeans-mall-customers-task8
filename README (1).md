# K-Means Clustering - Mall Customers

## 📌 Objective
Perform unsupervised clustering using K-Means on a mall customers dataset to identify distinct customer segments.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains details about customers, including:
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

Original CSV: `Mall_Customers.csv`  
Cleaned CSV: `Cleaned_Mall_Customers.csv`

## 🧠 Steps Followed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Normalized the features using StandardScaler
3. Applied the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
4. Performed K-Means clustering
5. Visualized clusters using PCA
6. Evaluated the model using the Silhouette Score

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Output
- Optimal clusters found using the Elbow Method
- Cluster visualization with PCA-reduced dimensions
- Silhouette Score for model evaluation

## 🔗 Submission
Submit the GitHub repo containing:
- Jupyter/Colab notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Cleaned dataset (`.csv`)
- README.md file (this file)
